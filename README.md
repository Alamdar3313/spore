# spore
paintable particle node for Maya

Spore is a set of Maya plug-ins and scripts. The Spore toolset is centered
around the sporeNode and sporeContext.

The sporeNode is a custom particle node that produces an "instanceData"
attribute which is designed to be hooked to Maya's particle instancer node.

The sporeContext is designed to place and manipulate those particles.

While particle instancing in Maya is an popular way to set dress
environments, the means of manipulating per particle attributes
are limited and require very specific knowledge.

Spore tries to create a more intuitive interface to manipulating points.
