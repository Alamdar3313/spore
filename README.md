# Spore

> Paintable particle node for Maya

Spore is a set of Maya plug-ins and scripts for Autodesk Maya.
The Spore toolset is based on the **sporeNode** and **sporeContext**.

The **sporeNode** is a custom dependency graph node that produces an *instanceData*
attribute which is designed to be hooked to Maya's particle instancer node.

The **sporeContext** is designed to place and manipulate points in the *instanceData* attribute.



# Motivation

While particle instancing in Maya is a popular way to populate environments,
the means of manipulating per-particle attributes with particles are limited
and require some specific knowledge.

Spore tries to create a more intuitive interface to creating and manipulating points that drive
Maya's particles instancer. Spore allows to scatter, paint and modify points in an easy an intuitive way.
Points can eigther be place with on of four different sampling algorithms or with an interactive brush context.
Once points have been placed in the scene they can be interactively and effortless modified using one
of four different "grooming" brushes.

# Installation

1. clone the git repo
```
git clone https://github.com/wiremas/spore
```
2. edit the spore.mod file to match the location on you machine:
```
spore any /path/to/spore/spore
```
3. make sure the spore.mod file is in your MAYA_MODULE_PATH environment variable


# Dependencies

In order to run **spore** you need to have **scipy** and **numpy** installed.


# Usage

Load the spore plugin from Maya's plugin manager.
Select your target surface than select all the object you want to scatter.
From the spore menu select "Create Spore Setup" or "Spore" to open the spore manager.

# sporeNode

The **sporeNode** takes an **inMesh** input attribute and creates an **instanceData** output attribute.
The **instanceData** attribute is designed to drive a particle instancer. To specify a target mesh connect the target's shape
**outMesh** attribute to the spore's **inMesh** attribute.

### Instanced Objects

The *Instanced Objects* menu give quick acces to adding or removing objects to the
instancer without the need to specifically select the instancer node.
The list mirrors the list of source objects displayed in the instancer node.

In addition the list also acts as modifier for most of the brush and sample operations.
Selecting one or more objects from the list will enable *Exclusive Mode*.
In *Exclusive Mode* only the selected objects IDs are considered for the specified operation.

### Instance Transforms

The *Instance Transforms* menu allows set transformations for instanced objects

| Attribute					|														|
| ------------------------- |:-----------------------------------------------------:|
| Align To					| Define a target vector for roation					|
| Weight					| Set weight of the target vector						|
| Min Rotation				| Minimum rotation values								|
| Max Rotation				| Maximum Rotation values								|
| Uniform Scale				| Scale XYZ uniformly (X defines the uniform value)		|
| Min Scale					| Minimum scale values									|
| Max Scale					| Maximum scale values									|
| Scale Factor				| Factor for increasing/decreasing scale values			|
| Randomize / Smooth		| Factor for randomizing/smoothing scale values 		|
| Min Offset				| Minimum offset along surface normal					|
| Max Offset				| Maximum offset along surface normal					|

---

### Brush

The *Brush* menu exposes basic brush settings.
For more detail on the individual brushes see [sporeContext](#sporeContext) section.

| Attribute					|														|
| ------------------------- |:----------------------------------------------------- |
| Tool						| Set the brush context to the specified mode			|
| Radius					| Define the brush radius								|
| Number Of Samples			| Number of points created by a single brush tick 		|
| Min Distance 				| Minimum distance between each brush tick				|
| Falloff					| Define a falloff for the brush						| 

---

### Emit

The *Emit* menu controls setting used for the next sampling operation.

| Attribute					|														|
| ------------------------- |:----------------------------------------------------- |
| Type						| Set the sampling type									|
| Number of Samples			| Number of samples generated by the random sampler		|
| Cell Size					| Cell size for the jitter gird							|
| Min Radius				| Minimum radius for the 3d disk sampler				|
| Min Radius 2d				| Minimum radius for the 2d disk sampler				|

The *sporeNode* features four different sampling types:
1. **random sampling**<br/>
   Distribute points uniform randomly across the surface.
   Fast, but sampled points tend to clump together or form empty spots<br/>
   <br/>   
2. **jitter grid**<br/>
   A uniform grid is created around an initial point cloud, generated by the random sampler.
   Than from each cell a random point is choose. This results in higher sampling times since
   some of the sampled points are discarded but the result look slightly more pleasing.<br/>
   <br/>
3. **3d poisson disk sampling**<br/>
   Generated poisson disk samples are at least the distance r apart from each other.<br/>
   This results in very pleasing result but take a lot longer to sample.
   Note: be carefure with the minRadius attribute since small values increase computation<br/>

   <br/>
4. **2d poisson disk sampling**<br/>
   Generate poisson disk samples in uv space that are at least the distance r apart from each other.<br/>
   Note: be carefure with the minRadius attribute since small values increase computation<br/>
   Note: samples will only be generated in the uv space from 0 to 1.
   Therefore the radius can not exceed 1.<br/>

*Geometry Cache*<br/>
<br/>
To accelerate sampling and other operations, target meshes will be cached in memory.
These cache objects are shared between nodes. Meaning that even if you create multiple spore nodes for the same mesh, the cache has to be created only once.
Depending on the size of the mesh, caching might take a few seconds.<br/>
To prevent a lot of computational overhead the cache will not update automatically when the mesh is transformed or deformed.
In general, every time the cache is requested, it will evaluate if there have been any changes to the mesh.
If this is the case it will automatically recache the mesh.
Just note, that whenever you modify you mesh you add some extra computation to you operations.

There is also the option to force a recache in the **Cache** menu.

#### Filtering

Sampled points can be filtered using one of the following operations:

1. **Texture Filter**<br/>
   The texture filter removes points based on an the incoming shading network's red channel.<br/>
   *Note*: Texture filtering is based on sampling uv coordinates for corresponding
   points. Sampling uv values take a long time on high poly meshes!<br/>
  
   | Attribute					|														|
   | -------------------------- |:----------------------------------------------------- |
   | Use Texture				| Enable texture filtering								|
   | Texutre					| Connect a shading network to evaluate					|

2. **Altitude Filter**<br/>
   Filters points based on hight relative to the targets bounding box.<br/>
   Use the fuzziness attribute to create a soft transition<br/>
   
   | Attribute					|														|
   | -------------------------- |:----------------------------------------------------- |
   | Min Altitude				| Set lower filter bound								|
   | Max Altitude				| Set upper filter bound								|
   | Min Altitude Fuzziness		| Set lower bound fuzziness								|
   | Max Altitude Fuzziness		| Set upper bound fuzziness								|

3. **Slope Filter**<br/>
   Filters points based on the angle between the surfaced normal and the world up vector<br/>
   Use the fuzziness attribute to create a soft transition<br/>

   | Attribute					|														|
   | -------------------------- |:----------------------------------------------------- |
   | Min Slope					| Minimal angle											|
   | Max Slope					| Maximal angle											|
   | Slope Fuzziness			| Set fuzziness											|

# sporeContext

The *sporeContext* is an interactive brush tool that can manipulate the sporeNode's 
"instanceData" attributes. The context features six differen modes plus modifiers.
Depending on the active context mode different brush controls are available directly
on the sporeNode.

Brush ticks can be modified using the *Min Distance* attribute

| Modifier					|														|
| ------------------------- |:----------------------------------------------------- |
| Shift						| ---													|
| Meta						| Assign random											|

### Delete Mode

Remove all instances within the given radius.
If the meta modifier key is pressed, n number of samples are randomly deleted per brush ticks.
Brush ticks can be modified using the *Min Distance* attribute.
While the tool is active objects can be restored using the shift modifier key.
Once the is left it is no longer possible to restore objects.

| Modifier					|														|
| ------------------------- |:----------------------------------------------------- |
| Shift						| Restore (Works only until the context is left)		|
| Meta						| Delete random											|

### Exclusive Mode
In **Exclusive Mode** the context works only on certain objectIndex IDs.
To activate **Exclusive Mode** select the desired sources objects in the
sporeNode's instance object list.

# sporeCommand
The spore command can be used to create a new spore setup from Maya's script editor.
```
cmds.spore()
```


# sporeManager

The **sporeManager** is a interface which lists all spore nodes in the scene.<br/>
It helps to quickly switch between different setups and display modes or create new spore nodes<br/>
